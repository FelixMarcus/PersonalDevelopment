# Manual4Me - Felix Millne

## Intent

This document is written to try to explain a little about me, Felix Millne, to help others who I am, what I care about and why I act certain ways. I write it in the hope that it helps it easier for me to integrate into new teams smoothly and to show my desires and plans for the future of my career. 

This is a living document, and I intend to continue updating it. If there is any feedback or comments that you would like to give, then I welcome it.

## How I Work

My nature is natually one of skepticism and curiousity. My style is often to question what people say, to scrutinise their reasoning and validate their thinking. This (I hope) comes not from a place of arrogance or meanness, but from a belief that multiple perspectives and the challenging of assumptions is important. I also find that it helps me to fully understand the dialogue and bring to the fore any misunderstandings that exist within the team. Raising these issues early tends to be a good thing.

I am a visual thinker, and work better with a broad understanding of the problem. I am one of those developers who works best with a whiteboard and a diagram that I can gesture at and record pieces of understanding on.

When confronting a new problem, I am a slow start. My approach is to ask questions and build a mental model of the problem, getting an intuitive feel for how the system works. This can come across as obtuse but I ask that you work with me to get my bearings. Once I have built my model I can usually keep up at a good clip.
